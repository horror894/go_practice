1: make complexity of for cicles lower - for fix this problem we need to use varible that contain count of record
a) case for list we know if cont of record is no and can write "Notepad is empty" without loop the whole list
b) in case of create we know what index we need to use for create record and we know if notepad full with out loop the whole list
2: add validation for size of note - if we use not int input we want to show "wrond value for capaciti of notepad please try again"
3: make metods instead code in main body
4: think about using structure and methods for this structure ?
5: check other solutions and create list of upgrades that I want to use
